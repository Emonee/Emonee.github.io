# My first portfolio

This is the portfolio that im currently working on. The goal is that people can quickly know my work and look at it.

## What techs are you using?

Mainly React. For supporting the styles im using react-bootstrap and bootstrap packages. For personal and custom css im using CSS Modals.

## How can i see the project

In the future the portfolio will have its own domain and will be deployed probably on Netlify. But, if you are curious about it, you can simply clone the project, install all the dependencies with the npm and then run the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Emonee/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
npm i
npm start
```
Any advice or help are welcome! ðŸ˜„
