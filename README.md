# My first portfolio

This is the portfolio. The goal is that people can quickly know my work and look at it.

## What techs are you using?

Mainly React. For supporting the styles im using react-bootstrap and bootstrap packages. For personal and custom css im using CSS Modals.

## How can i see the project?

This page is deployed on GitHub pages, using a domain purchased at AWS. You can see the result right [here](https://emilianoaf.com). If you are curious about the project in depth, you can simply clone it, install all the dependencies with npm and finally run the page in your locale machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Emonee/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
npm i
npm start
```
Any advice or help are welcome! ðŸ˜„
